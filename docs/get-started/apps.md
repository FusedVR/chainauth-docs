# Application Management

Through the ChainAuth Console, you will be able to create, manage, and monitor the usage of the ChainAuth SDK or APIs for your game or application. Simply log-in into the console with an e-mail address and a Web 3 wallet to get started. 

## Create App

To start using the APIs and SDKs, you will need to create an application to receive an App ID, which can be used for the login function.

```csharp
bool isLoggedIn = await Web3Manager.Login("email", "appId");
```
Creating an application just requires an **App Image** and **App Name**, which will be used to customize the login authentication email that is sent out to your players.
