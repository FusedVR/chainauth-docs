# Sell Your Game as an NFT

In this guide, we will showcase an end to end open source project that demonstrates how your users can mint NFT tickets for your game or application and how that can be authenticated within Unity using the FusedVR Chain Auth Platform and SDK. This use case serves as a way to not only sell tickets to your game, but also give players control of owning your game, just like a physical game cartridge. 

The Unity project and front-end minting HTML code are both avaliable on [Github in the master and gh-pages branches](https://github.com/FusedVR/chainauth-unity), respectively. 

## Demo

### Mint your own NFT

To try out the demo, first head over to [https://fusedvr.github.io/chainauth-unity](https://fusedvr.github.io/chainauth-unity), which is where the HTML client for minting a NFT is hosted. Currently, the demo is only working on the Polygon network, but the smart contract code is avaliable to use on Github. You can also easily create the smart contract code with the [Open Zepplin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/).

This demo will mint a custom NFT for the smart contract, which you will now prove to Unity you own. 

### Chain Auth - NFT Proof

Coming soon!
