ChainAuth provides a simplied solution to Game Developers for one of the many difficulties when developing a Web 3 standalone game : authenticating a player's non-custodial wallet to prove ownership of the tokens, NFTs, or other digital assets a player owns . Why is this a challenge? Players can own digital assets across a wide range of wallets (Metamask, Coinbase, Trust Wallet, etc.) on various different blockchains (ethereum, binance, polygon, etc.) and games should be flexible to support as many players as possible. One common workaround to this problem is to have the game (or typically a 3rd party service) manage the wallet on behalf of players, known as a custodial wallet. But this fundamentally looks no different from Web 2 and defeats the purpose of enabling players to have true ownership of their assets in the metaverse. The only secure way to prove that players own a given wallet is to ask them to sign a random message (nonce) with the wallet's private key and then cryptographically validate that the signature could only have been generated with the player's private key. However, without a backend solution, most wallets do not natively have a means to connect with other standalone applications. While some solutions exist if the game or app exists in a browser or for just mobile wallets using Wallet Connect, ChainAuth provides the APIs and SDKs neccesary to validate your players' wallets whether they prefer using : - Mobile Wallet Apps i.e. Metamask Android or iOS - Web Browser Wallets i.e. Brave or Metamask - or Hardware Wallets i.e. Ledger or Trezor ChainAuth enables developers to either provide players a one time code for authentication or send them a magic link email to their players to start the authentication process. By going to https://link.fusedvr.com , players can input that code in the browser, which will request a signature from their web browser wallet, hardware wallet, or mobile wallet through Wallet Connect. Players will sign a randomly generated message (nonce), which is sent back to your game along with the validated wallet address. Once validated, you can now read the state of the blockchain to see what NFTs, tokens, and assets a player has on any chain associated with that address using the APIs provided. Why FusedVR ChainAuth The ChainAuth solution by FusedVR is designed by a developers to make it incredibly simple for developers to solve the authentication problem either using the Unity SDK or via our API integration. For indie developers working in Unity, the SDK integration is as simple as : Add the Web3 SDK to your project via the Package Manager Call the Register Function with a unique identified and your application id to get a manager instance Give code from the Register Function to the player in order to input on https://link.fusedvr.com Call the Login function in the SDK with that code and await the player's authorization signature Web3Manager manager = await Web3Manager.Register(\"unique id\", \"appId\"); Debug.Log(manager.RegisterCode); //auth code for player to input Debug.Log( await manager.GetMagicLink() ); //link version of code if (await manager.AwaitLogin()) { //await for player to login //your game logic here CallAPIs(manager, Web3Manager.CHAIN.eth); } Use Cases The ChainAuth solution provides an efficient solution for passwordless authentication of players, which enables use cases that require just reading the state of the blockchain once authenticated. Such use cases could include: Determining if a player owns digital assets associated with the game i.e. avatar skins, in game items, or tokens. Determining if a player owns an NFT the represents ownership of the game Whether or not a player has interacted with a custom smart contract and the events emitted as a result Cross-Chain ownership of EVM assets, such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, or Ethereum The ChainAuth APIs and SDKs are NOT currently recommended for writing transactions to the blockchain from your game. For such use cases, it is recommended to create your own dApp outside of the standalone game that players can interact with such as a NFT marketplace. More work & research is required to make the UX of the onboarding process as seamless as possible for new users, especially those who have never used the blockchain before.","title":"ChainAuth for Game Developers"},{"location":"docs/#chainauth-for-game-developers","text":"","title":"ChainAuth for Game Developers"},{"location":"docs/#what-is-chainauth","text":"ChainAuth provides a simplied solution to Game Developers for one of the many difficulties when developing a Web 3 standalone game : authenticating a player's non-custodial wallet to prove ownership of the tokens, NFTs, or other digital assets a player owns .

The goal of the SDK is to enable you to authenticate your player's Web 3 wallets and enable them to prove ownership of their digital assets like tokens & NFTs. This guide will walk you through how to use the SDK to get access to the SDK, authenticate a player, and then verify the assets the player owns, which you can use however you like in the game. Setup SDK The ChainAuth Unity SDK is avaliable on Github as an open source project . To use the SDK, you will require an Application ID, which you can request on the FusedVR Discord Server . Once you have an Application ID, you can import the Github repo into your repository as a Unity Package. In your Unity Project, open the Package Manager, which is under Window > Package Manager . Click the + icon and select Add package from git URL... This will prompt you to input a URL, in which you should paste the Git URL : https://github.com/FusedVR/web3-unity-sdk.git . Click Add , which begin the process of importing the SDK into your project. Authenticating Players with their Wallet Once you have installed the SDK, you will need to integrate the Client Registration and Login Sequence into your game in order to authenticate players. The following code snippet shows an example of how you can authenticate players with just a few lines of code. In this section, we will walk through what each of these functions does in the authenticate process for players. Web3Manager manager = await Web3Manager.Register(\"unique id\", \"appId\"); //register the client with the APIs Debug.Log(manager.RegisterCode); //auth code for player to input into the link page received from Registration if (await manager.AwaitLogin()) { //await player login //your game logic here CallAPIs(manager, Web3Manager.CHAIN.eth); } Register and Get Registration Code The first step in using the SDK is Registering the Client. To do so, call the static function Register , which is responsible for calling the Register API for you. THe parameters that are required are a unique ID for this client and the Application ID from above. NOTE: if the unique ID is an email address, an email will automatically be sent to the player, which will allow them to click on the link and authenticate without the need for a code. Web3Manager manager = await Web3Manager.Register(\"unique id\", \"appId\"); //register the client with the APIs The SDK will return a Web3Manager Object, which will enable you to make all the required calls for other supported functionality below. This object will store the Registeration Code that is retured from calling the Register API. You will need to provide this code to the player on a GUI so that they can input the code into https://link.fusedvr.com manager.RegisterCode; //auth code for player to input into the link page received from Registration These codes are only valid for 10 minutes. If the code has become invalid, you may call the non-static Register function to re-register and get a valid code. string code = await manager.Register(); //re-register to get new auth code Magic Link Alternatively, if you would like to provide a clickable experience without a code, you call call the GetMagicLink function after Register. This will return a URL, which players can click on to start the authentication process to your application without having to enter a code. Web3Manager manager = await Web3Manager.Register(\"unique id\", \"appId\"); //register the client with the APIs string magicLink = await manager.GetMagicLink(); //gets the magic link for the player Await Login Once you have registered the player and have provided them a means to start the authentication process (via email, code, or magic link), you then need to wait for them to authenticate their wallet. To await for the player to login, you can call the AwaitLogin function. bool success = await manager.AwaitLogin(); //awaits player login This will return once the login process is complete whether or not it was succesful, at which point you can start reading the state of their wallet. Verifying Player's Digital Assets on the Blockchain Authentication Token Once a player has logged in and authenticated your app, you will receive back a JWT token, which when decoded contains important information, such as the player's wallet address & the signature proof they used to authenticate. A valid token will enable you to call FusedVR APIs and read the state of the blockchain more easily. This token is saved in your Player Prefs, so that you can quickly login players between sessions without needing to re-authenticate each time. This requires the Unique ID you used to remain the same between sessions. You can get the Bearer Token at any time from a Logged In user through the Web3Manager and Decode it to see the contents of the token, which are stored as a key value pair in a dictionary. string token = manager.GetBearerToken(); //get token Dictionary<string, string> tokenContent = Web3Manager.DecodeJWT(token); //decode contents of the token as a key-value pair Player Address As mentioned above, the player's authenticated wallet address is stored within the token. To make it easier to get the player's address, a wrapper function is provided. string address = mngr.GetAddress(); //get the wallet address used for authentication Select Chain The FusedVR Crypto supports a subset of EVM compatiable blockchains & testnets, which stored in the CHAIN sub-class. When you call any of the following functions, you will be required to pass an instance of the CHAIN object, which will indicate which blockchain to query. Here are the currently supported chains: Web3Manager.CHAIN.eth Web3Manager.CHAIN.ropsten Web3Manager.CHAIN.rinkeby Web3Manager.CHAIN.goerli Web3Manager.CHAIN.polygon Web3Manager.CHAIN.mumbai Web3Manager.CHAIN.bsc Web3Manager.CHAIN.bsctestnet Get Native Balance string balance = await mngr.GetNativeBalance(chain); Get ERC-20 Tokens List<Dictionary<string, string>> erc20s = await mngr.GetERC20Tokens(chain); Get NFT Tokens List<Dictionary<string, string>> nfts = await mngr.GetNFTTokens(chain);","title":"Hello World - Unity SDK"},{"location":"docs/tutorials/helloworld/#hello-world-unity","text":"The FusedVR ChainAuth Unity SDK is designed to be as simple as possible to integrate into any game or application.
