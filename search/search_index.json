ChainAuth provides a simplied solution to Game Developers for one of the many difficulties when developing a Web 3 standalone game : authenticating a player's non-custodial wallet to prove ownership of the tokens, NFTs, or other digital assets a player owns . Why is this a challenge? Players can own digital assets across a wide range of wallets (Metamask, Coinbase, Trust Wallet, etc.) on various different blockchains (ethereum, binance, polygon, etc.) and games should be flexible to support as many players as possible. One common workaround to this problem is to have the game (or typically a 3rd party service) manage the wallet on behalf of players, known as a custodial wallet. But this fundamentally looks no different from Web 2 and defeats the purpose of enabling players to have true ownership of their assets in the metaverse. The only secure way to prove that players own a given wallet is to ask them to sign a random message (nonce) with the wallet's private key and then cryptographically validate that the signature could only have been generated with the player's private key. However, without a backend solution, most wallets do not natively have a means to connect with other standalone applications. While some solutions exist if the game or app exists in a browser or for just mobile wallets using Wallet Connect, ChainAuth provides the APIs and SDKs neccesary to validate your players' wallets whether they prefer using : - Mobile Wallet Apps i.e. Metamask Android or iOS - Web Browser Wallets i.e. Brave or Metamask - or Hardware Wallets i.e. Ledger or Trezor ChainAuth enables developers to either provide players a one time code for authentication or send them a magic link email to their players to start the authentication process. By going to https://link.fusedvr.com , players can input that code in the browser, which will request a signature from their web browser wallet, hardware wallet, or mobile wallet through Wallet Connect. Players will sign a randomly generated message (nonce), which is sent back to your game along with the validated wallet address. Once validated, you can now read the state of the blockchain to see what NFTs, tokens, and assets a player has on any chain associated with that address using the APIs provided. Why FusedVR ChainAuth The ChainAuth solution by FusedVR is designed by a developers to make it incredibly simple for developers to solve the authentication problem either using the Unity SDK or via our API integration. For indie developers working in Unity, the SDK integration is as simple as : Add the Web3 SDK to your project via the Package Manager Call the Register Function (optionally with an e-mail address) with your application id to get a manger instance with the code Call the Login function in the SDK with that code and await the player's authorization signature Web3Manager manager = await Web3Manager.Register(\"email\", \"appId\"); Debug.LogError( await manager.GetMagicLink() ); if (await manager.AwaitLogin()) { //your game logic here CallAPIs(manager, Web3Manager.CHAIN.eth); } Use Cases The ChainAuth solution provides an efficient solution for passwordless authentication of players, which enables use cases that require just reading the state of the blockchain once authenticated. Such use cases could include: Determining if a player owns digital assets associated with the game i.e. avatar skins, in game items, or tokens. Determining if a player owns an NFT the represents ownership of the game Whether or not a player has interacted with a custom smart contract and the events emitted as a result Cross-Chain ownership of EVM assets, such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, or Ethereum The ChainAuth APIs and SDKs are NOT currently recommended for writing transactions to the blockchain from your game. For such use cases, it is recommended to create your own dApp outside of the standalone game that players can interact with such as a NFT marketplace. More work & research is required to make the UX of the onboarding process as seamless as possible for new users, especially those who have never used the blockchain before.","title":"ChainAuth for Game Developers"},{"location":"docs/#chainauth-for-game-developers","text":"","title":"ChainAuth for Game Developers"},{"location":"docs/#what-is-chainauth","text":"ChainAuth provides a simplied solution to Game Developers for one of the many difficulties when developing a Web 3 standalone game : authenticating a player's non-custodial wallet to prove ownership of the tokens, NFTs, or other digital assets a player owns .

This use case serves as a way to not only sell tickets to your game, but also give players control of owning your game, just like a physical game cartridge. The Unity project and front-end minting HTML code are both avaliable on Github in the master and gh-pages branches , respectively. Components Mint your own NFT HTML Page To try out the HTML page, first head over to https://fusedvr.github.io/chainauth-unity , which is where the HTML client for minting a NFT is hosted. Currently, the demo is only working on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet network, but the Javascript code that controls this is located in gh-pages branch under assets/nfts/web3modal.js , where you can change the network. It leverages the Web3 Modal open source project to allow wallets to connect via native integrations like Metamask or Wallet Connect. The HTML page is responsible for allowing you to mint your own custom NFT with its own unique ID. NFT Smart Contract The smart contract is an open sourced ERC-721 contract and avaliable on Github . It was built using the Open Zepplin Wizard , which enabled minting & burning of NFTs. You can use the same tool to create your own custom contract and then deploy it using a tool like Remix . Unity Project The Unity Project is located on the master branch and the main map generation is based on the project from Catlike Coding . The project utilizes the FusedVR Chain Auth solution in order to authenticate a player's wallet and confirm ownership of their assets. By logging into the service with their e-mail address, users are able to sign a confirmation message from the wallet of their choice, whether it is desktop or mobile. Then using the SDK, the game can see the list of NFTs owned by the player. With the list of NFTs owned by the player, we can generate the maps using the IDs as a random seed for generation. This ensures the maps that are generated are unique to the player's token id and can only be generated if a player owns the token.
