# Getting Started

The FusedVR ChainAuth APIs are designed to be as simple as possible to integrate into any game or application. 

First you will need an Application ID for your project. As the next phase of this project, we intend to have a dashboard where you can create, manage, and gain insights into your application. For the time being, please request an application id on the [FusedVR Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rV8fEAmG5B) in the #crypto channel. 

Once you have an Application ID, you can start using either 
- <a href="https://api-crypto.fusedvr.com" target="_blank">The FusedVR Crypto APIs</a> 
- <a href="https://github.com/FusedVR/web3-unity-sdk" target="_blank">The Unity SDK</a> wrapper for making requests and authenticating players. 

For a guide on how to use the Unity SDK, please refer to the [Hello World tutorial]("/docs/tutorials/helloworld/").
